# Midterm Notes for ML

## Lecture 1

    What is machine learning?
    
        Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that is focused on the creation of algorithms.
        It enable a system to learn from data and previous experiences.
        In a nutshell we create a model, without explicit programming, which aids in making predictions or forecasting.

    Feature of ML:
        There are several features of Ml that are as follows:
            1. It can detect patterns in a given dataset.
            2. It can learn from previous encounter/data and improve automatically.
            3. It is data-driven Technology.
   
    Types of ML:
        There are 4 Types of ML that are as follows:
            1. Supervised ML
            2. Un Supervised ML
            3. Semi Supervised ML
            4. Reinforced ML

### Supervised ML

    How Does Supervised ML Classify?

        Supervised Machine Learning is when Labeled data is provided to the system for training, then based on the labeled training data some predictions are done as an output.
        Then the based on the training data a model is build which is later tested with unknown or fresh raw data to check its capability to accurately predict the correct output/label.

### Un Supervised ML

    How Does Un-Supervised ML Classify?

        Un-supervised Machine Learning is when unlabeled data is provided to the system for training, ut has to identify relations and patterns between the provided data and then has to group records/instances/data into the related or similar pattern groups.

### SemiSupervised ML

    How Does SemiSupervised ML Classify?

        SemiSupervised machine learning is a combination of both Supervised and unsupervised learning, the dataset has both labeled and unlabeled data, the labeled data is first train to create more datasets
