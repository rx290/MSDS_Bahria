## Hadoop

### History of Hadoop

`Hadoop originated from Google's MapReduce and Google File System (GFS) papers (2003-2004). Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella created Hadoop in 2005, naming it after Cutting's son's toy elephant.

### What is hadoop?

    Hadoop is an open-source, distributed computing framework for storing and processing large datasets.

### Hadoop Framework Modules?

    Hadoop framework consists of:
      - Common (utilities)
      - HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
      - YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)
      - MapReduce (processing)

                1. Why was Hadoop needed?

        Hadoop was needed to store and process exponentially growing datasets, handle various data types, and provide faster processing.

        5. Hadoop Ecosystem

        Hadoop ecosystem includes tools and technologies that integrate with Hadoop for data processing, analytics, and management.

        6. Hadoop Vendors

        Key Hadoop vendors:

        - Apache
        - Cloudera
        - Hortonworks
        - MapR
        - IBM
        - Microsoft

### Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS)

    HDFS is a distributed storage system for large datasets, providing scalability and fault tolerance.

### How Hadoop fixes problems

    Hadoop addresses:

    - Storing exponentially growing datasets: scalable storage
    - Storing different types of data: flexible data handling
    - Processing data faster: parallel processing

### Hadoop Architecture

     Master-Slave Architecture in Hadoop

    (Mind Map)

        Hadoop Cluster
        |- NameNode (Master)
        |- DataNodes (Slaves)
        |- JobTracker (Master)
        |- TaskTrackers (Slaves)
